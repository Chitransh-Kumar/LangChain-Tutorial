# Chat Models

These are the language models that are specialised for conversational tasks. They take a sequence of messages as input and return chat messages as output.

LangChain models are divided into two categories:

- `Language Models`: Commonly used for making chatbots.

-  `Embedding Models`: Commonly used for semantic search.

Notes:

1. In .env file store the API key and in the main code add `load_dotenv()` to load API key from .env file.

2. `temparature` parameter is used to add creativity in the output generated by the LLM. Higher `temperature` means higher creativity.
